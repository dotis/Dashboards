### Dashboard tasks at the beginning of each calendar year
1. Change date of 7-day sat. mean file generation (move up one day)
2. For sat. data extractions, run full extraction on all files to update the .mat files
3. Then, update the "time cut" in the MAT2CSV.M routines to reflect Jan. 1 and Dec. 31 respectively
