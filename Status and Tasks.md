## Outstanding tasks for L2 processing and dashboards

### L2 processing
### Moving to using only GOM as an ROI (will remove FK and FGB)

### Outstanding tasks:
1. Re-run MODA GOM (OC and SST, SST4 is done)
2. Run new CLIMs for GOM OC and SST with all prods; SST4 is done); need CLIMs for all VSNPP
3. Check ERDDAP status for GOM datasets
