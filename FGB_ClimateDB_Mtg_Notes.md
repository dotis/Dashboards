### Notes from FGB Climate Dashboard Workshop/meeting 
### 9/14/2023

FGB Science Staff, Gretchen from Auburn. Mention of NCAR (dashboard) - Kristen, Deepak

1. Demo of dashboard. Not very tailored at this point. Also showing a zooplankton projection.
2. Zoos data is not validated.
3. Also have the capability to model at depth: will tailor this to each sanctuary.
4. CESM-MARBLE model (phyto, zoo types - run along with climate)
5. Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL)  https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002647
6. Community Earth System Model (CESM)
7. FEISTY model (newish) - fish types  - forage, pelagic, demersal (not species)
8. Colorblind friendly palettes, or use patterns
9. Bar graphs for bleaching (508 compliance issues). Use dropdown to select year, then show percentages for selected year.
10. Find a way to incorporate more explanatory text (model info, definitions, refs, etc.)
11. Bleaching model - does this incorporate light, DHW, circulation?
12. NCAR working on a storminess indicator
13. Three main concerns (Michelle J. - temp (bleaching), storm severity, pH)
14. MLD - y-axis is flipped
15. Add DO, aragonite saturation?
16. How to show habitat by depth? - Or all depth bins on the same plot
17. For bleaching, dropdown with decades
18. Can we merge the existing FGBNMS dashboard and the climate dashboard? - Can we show imagery in Quarto?
19.
