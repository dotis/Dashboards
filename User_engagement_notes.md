## User engagement notes

What do users want?

Not new dashboards. Not new portals. One stop shop per location. Grafana? Quarto?

### Products:

Turbidity. How is human use/boating related to WQ? Do vessels drive turbidity signal?

Other products to add? Michelle Johnston may have ideas. 

FGBNMS dashboard is very useful. Can we export to other locations? One limitation is 1-km imagery.  

Can we use S2/S3 to look at WQ over reefs in the FL Keys? MODA is too coarse.

Where are products going to sit? Santuary Watch? MBON dashboards? Simple Quarto boards w/climatologies, simple time series?
