## User engagement notes

What do users want?

Not new dashboards. Not new portals. One stop shop per location. Grafana? Quarto?

### Products:

Turbidity. How is human use/boating related to WQ? Do vessels drive turbidity signal (cruise ships, recreational boats)?

HABs, other WQ params. Params at depth (50-100m). 

Other products to add? Michelle Johnston may have ideas. We may need to move to Quarto. 

FGBNMS dashboard is very useful. Can we export to other locations? One limitation is 1-km imagery. 

Can we develop 1-km imagery for US East Coast, West Coast, Great Lakes, Pacific? We can do this, but will take time. 

Can we use S2/S3 to look at WQ over reefs in the FL Keys? MODA is too coarse.

Where are products going to sit? Santuary Watch? MBON dashboards? Simple Quarto boards w/climatologies, simple time series?
